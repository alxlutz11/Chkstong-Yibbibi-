# Chkstong-Yibbibi-
CSCE 470 Chkstong Yibbibi

This is a project for CSCE 470 that implements a convolutional neural network to recognize Chkstong Yibbibi in a set of hexadecimal bytes. I pulled most of my information regarding how to actually find the chkstong yibbibi from Alex's useful tutorial here http://people.tamu.edu/~lutz_840746/Chkstong-Yibbibi.html.

The inspiration behind this project came from a Blog written by Dr. Chkstong Yibbibi. He has written a blog post that talks about some of his works here https://chkstongyibbibi277231967.wordpress.com/blog/. Please take some time to check them out!
